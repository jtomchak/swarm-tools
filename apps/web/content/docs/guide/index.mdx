## Core Concepts

### Swarm Coordination

Swarm Tools enables multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks. The system handles:

- **Task Decomposition** - Breaking large tasks into parallelizable subtasks
- **File Reservations** - Preventing edit conflicts between agents
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitoring swarm status and completion
- **Learning** - Improving decomposition strategies over time

### Beads Issue Tracking

Git-backed issue tracking that integrates with swarm workflows:

- **Epics** - High-level tasks with subtasks
- **Dependencies** - Block/blocked-by relationships
- **Status Tracking** - Open, in-progress, blocked, closed
- **Git Sync** - JSONL export for distributed collaboration

### Agent Mail

Inter-agent communication for coordination:

- **Messages** - Async communication between agents
- **Reservations** - File locking for exclusive edits
- **Threads** - Conversation grouping by bead/epic
