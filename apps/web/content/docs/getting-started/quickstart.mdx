# Quickstart

Multi-agent coordination for your codebase. Install, setup, `/swarm` your first task.

**What you get:** Parallel worker agents, automatic file locking, persistent learning, git-backed work tracking.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

Or with Bun:
```bash
bun add -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, OpenCode CLI, git repository

## Setup

```bash
swarm setup
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Migrating from PGLite to libSQL...
✓ OpenCode plugin configured
✓ Hive initialized at .hive/
✓ All systems ready
```

This handles migrations automatically, configures the OpenCode plugin, and initializes the hive (git-backed work tracker).

**Check health:**
```bash
swarm doctor
```

```
✓ OpenCode plugin configured
✓ Hive storage: libSQL (embedded SQLite)
✓ Semantic memory: ready
✓ Dependencies: all installed
```

## Your First Swarm

In OpenCode:

```
/swarm "Add a health check endpoint at /api/health"
```

**What happens:**

```
Analyzing task...
Decomposing into 2 subtasks:
  1. Create /api/health endpoint
  2. Add health check test

Creating epic: bd-abc123
  ├─ bd-abc123.1 (worker-1)
  └─ bd-abc123.2 (worker-2)

Spawning 2 worker agents...

[worker-1] Reserved: src/api/health.ts
[worker-1] ✓ Created endpoint
[worker-2] Reserved: src/api/health.test.ts
[worker-2] ✓ Added tests

✓ All subtasks complete
✓ UBS scan: 0 issues
✓ Synced to git
```

**Files created:**
- `src/api/health.ts` - endpoint implementation
- `src/api/health.test.ts` - test coverage
- `.hive/issues.jsonl` - work tracking (git-committed)

## How Swarm Works

1. **Decompose** - Break task into parallel subtasks
2. **Reserve** - Each worker locks their files (no conflicts)
3. **Execute** - Workers run in parallel, report progress
4. **Verify** - UBS bug scan, type check, test run
5. **Complete** - Release locks, sync to git, store learnings

## Optional: Vector Search

For semantic memory (search learnings by meaning, not keywords):

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

**Without Ollama:** Falls back to full-text search. Everything still works.

## Key Tools (For Manual Control)

Most work happens via `/swarm`, but you can drive manually:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hive_ready()` | Get next unblocked task |
| `hive_create()` | Create new work item |
| `hive_sync()` | Sync to git (MANDATORY at session end) |
| `swarmmail_init()` | Initialize coordination for multi-agent work |
| `swarmmail_reserve()` | Lock files before editing |
| `swarm_complete()` | Finish task + cleanup |
| `skills_use()` | Load domain expertise (testing, CLI building, etc) |
| `semantic-memory_store()` | Store learnings for future sessions |
| `semantic-memory_find()` | Search past learnings by meaning |

## Using Semantic Memory

```typescript
// After solving a tricky bug
semantic-memory_store({
  information: "OAuth refresh tokens need 5min buffer before expiry to avoid race conditions. Implemented with: if (expiresAt - Date.now() < 300000) refresh()",
  tags: "auth,tokens,race-conditions"
})

// Before starting similar work
semantic-memory_find({
  query: "token refresh race conditions",
  limit: 5
})
```

Memories persist across sessions. 90-day decay keeps knowledge fresh.

## Using Skills

Pre-built expertise packages:

```typescript
skills_list() // See available skills
skills_use({ name: "testing-patterns" }) // Load Feathers' dependency-breaking techniques
skills_use({ name: "swarm-coordination" }) // Multi-agent orchestration patterns
```

Bundled skills: **testing-patterns**, **swarm-coordination**, **cli-builder**, **system-design**

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `swarm setup` | Initial configuration (run once) |
| `swarm doctor` | Check dependencies and health |
| `swarm init` | Initialize hive in new project |
| `swarm config` | Show config paths |

## What's Next

- [OpenCode Plugin Reference](/docs/reference/opencode-plugin) - All 40+ tools documented
- [Philosophy](/docs/getting-started/philosophy) - Design principles and mental models
- [Patterns](/docs/patterns) - Coordination patterns and best practices
- [Swarm Mail Architecture](/docs/packages/swarm-mail) - Event sourcing deep dive
- [Semantic Memory](/docs/packages/swarm-mail/memory) - Persistent agent learning

## Troubleshooting

**"swarmmail_init failed"**
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check `.opencode/` directory is writable

**"Plugin not loading"**
```bash
swarm setup  # Re-run setup
swarm doctor # Check what's missing
```

**Migrations stuck**
- `swarm setup` auto-migrates PGLite → libSQL
- Check `.hive/` directory permissions
- Run `swarm doctor` to verify storage

## Session Checklist

Every session:

1. **Start:** `hive_ready()` - What's next?
2. **Work:** `/swarm` for parallel tasks OR use tools manually
3. **End:** `hive_sync()` + `git push` - **The plane is not landed until `git push` succeeds**

That's it. Install, setup, `/swarm`. Ship it.
