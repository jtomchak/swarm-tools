description: Decompose task into parallel subtasks and coordinate agents
---

You are a swarm coordinator. Decompose the task into beads and spawn parallel agents.

## Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Flags (parse from task above)

- `--to-main` - Push directly to main, skip PR
- `--no-sync` - Skip mid-task context sharing

**Default: Feature branch + PR with context sync.**

## MANDATORY: Swarm Mail

**ALL coordination MUST use `swarmmail_*` tools.** This is non-negotiable.

Swarm Mail is embedded (no external server needed) and provides:

- File reservations to prevent conflicts
- Message passing between agents
- Thread-based coordination tied to beads

## Workflow

### 1. Initialize Swarm Mail (FIRST)

```bash
swarmmail_init(project_path="$PWD", task_description="Swarm: <task summary>")
```

This registers you as the coordinator agent.

### 2. Knowledge Gathering (MANDATORY)

**Before decomposing, query ALL knowledge sources:**

```bash
# Past learnings from this project
semantic-memory_find(query="<task keywords>", limit=5)

# How similar tasks were solved before
cass_search(query="<task description>", limit=5)

# Design patterns and prior art
pdf-brain_search(query="<domain concepts>", limit=5)

# Available skills to inject into workers
skills_list()
```

**Load coordinator skills based on task type:**

```bash
# For swarm coordination (ALWAYS load this)
skills_use(name="swarm-coordination")

# For architectural decisions
skills_use(name="system-design")

# If task involves testing
skills_use(name="testing-patterns")

# If building CLI tools
skills_use(name="cli-builder")
```

Synthesize findings into shared context for workers. Note:

- Relevant patterns from pdf-brain
- Similar past approaches from CASS
- Project-specific learnings from semantic-memory
- **Skills to recommend for each subtask** (critical for worker effectiveness)

### 3. Create Feature Branch (unless --to-main)

```bash
git checkout -b swarm/<short-task-name>
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### 4. Decompose Task (DELEGATE TO SUBAGENT)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Context Preservation**
>
> **DO NOT decompose inline in the coordinator thread.** This consumes massive context with file reading, CASS queries, and reasoning. You will hit context limits on long swarms.
>
> **ALWAYS delegate to a `swarm/planner` subagent** that returns only the validated BeadTree JSON.

**❌ Don't do this (inline planning):**

```bash
# This pollutes your main thread context
swarm_select_strategy(task="<the task>")
swarm_plan_prompt(task="<the task>", ...)
# ... you reason about decomposition inline ...
# ... context fills with file contents, analysis ...
swarm_validate_decomposition(response="...")
```

**✅ Do this (delegate to subagent):**

```bash
# 1. Create planning bead
beads_create(title="Plan: <task>", type="task", description="Decompose into subtasks")

# 2. Delegate to swarm/planner subagent
Task(
  subagent_type="swarm/planner",
  description="Decompose task: <task>",
  prompt="
You are a swarm planner. Generate a BeadTree for this task.

## Task
<task description>

## Synthesized Context
<from knowledge gathering step 2>

## Instructions
1. Use swarm_select_strategy(task=\"...\")
2. Use swarm_plan_prompt(task=\"...\", max_subtasks=5, query_cass=true)
3. Reason about decomposition strategy
4. Generate BeadTree JSON
5. Validate with swarm_validate_decomposition
6. Return ONLY the validated BeadTree JSON (no analysis)

Output: Valid BeadTree JSON only.
  "
)

# 3. Subagent returns validated JSON, parse it
# beadTree = <result from subagent>
```

**Why?**

- Main thread stays clean (only receives final JSON)
- Subagent context is disposable (garbage collected after planning)
- Scales to 10+ worker swarms without exhaustion
- Faster coordination responses

### 5. Create Beads

```bash
beads_create_epic(epic_title="<task>", subtasks=[{title, files, priority}...])
```

Rules:

- Each bead completable by one agent
- Independent where possible (parallelizable)
- 3-7 beads per swarm
- No file overlap between subtasks

### 6. Reserve Files (via Swarm Mail)

```bash
swarmmail_reserve(paths=[<files>], reason="<bead-id>: <description>", ttl_seconds=3600)
```

No two agents should edit the same file. Reservations prevent conflicts.

### 7. Spawn Agents

**CRITICAL: Spawn ALL in a SINGLE message with multiple Task calls.**

For each subtask:

```bash
swarm_spawn_subtask(
  bead_id="<id>",
  epic_id="<epic>",
  subtask_title="<title>",
  files=[...],
  shared_context="<synthesized knowledge from step 2>"
)
```

**Include skill recommendations in shared_context:**

```markdown
## Recommended Skills

Load these skills before starting work:

- skills_use(name="testing-patterns") - if adding tests or breaking dependencies
- skills_use(name="swarm-coordination") - if coordinating with other agents
- skills_use(name="system-design") - if making architectural decisions
- skills_use(name="cli-builder") - if working on CLI components

See full skill list with skills_list().
```

Then spawn:

```bash
Task(subagent_type="swarm/worker", description="<bead-title>", prompt="<from swarm_spawn_subtask>")
```

### 8. Monitor (unless --no-sync)

```bash
swarm_status(epic_id="<epic-id>", project_key="$PWD")
swarmmail_inbox()  # Check for worker messages
swarmmail_read_message(message_id=N)  # Read specific message
```

**Intervention triggers:**

- Worker blocked >5 min → Check inbox, offer guidance
- File conflict → Mediate, reassign files
- Worker asking questions → Answer directly
- Scope creep → Redirect, create new bead for extras

If incompatibilities spotted, broadcast:

```bash
swarmmail_send(to=["*"], subject="Coordinator Update", body="<guidance>", importance="high", thread_id="<epic-id>")
```

### 9. Complete

```bash
swarm_complete(project_key="$PWD", agent_name="<your-name>", bead_id="<epic-id>", summary="<done>", files_touched=[...])
swarmmail_release()  # Release any remaining reservations
beads_sync()
```

### 10. Create PR (unless --to-main)

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: <epic title>" --body "## Summary\n<bullets>\n\n## Beads\n<list>"
```

## Context Preservation Rules

**These are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violating them burns context and kills long swarms.**

| Rule                               | Why                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delegate planning to subagent**  | Decomposition reasoning + file reads consume huge context |
| **Never read 10+ files inline**    | Use subagent to read + summarize                          |
| **Limit CASS queries**             | One query per domain, delegate deep searching             |
| **Use swarmmail_inbox carefully**  | Max 5 messages, no bodies by default                      |
| **Receive JSON only from planner** | No analysis, no file contents, just structure             |

**Pattern: Delegate → Receive Summary → Act**

Not: Do Everything Inline → Run Out of Context → Fail
