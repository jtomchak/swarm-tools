{"id":"bd-lf2p4u-mjbmnkstm8b","title":"Cell IDs should use project name prefix instead of generic 'bd'","description":"**Current:** All cell IDs use generic `bd-` prefix (e.g., `bd-lf2p4u-mjbmk0vhuya`)\n\n**Proposed:** Use slugified project name from package.json as prefix:\n- `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-abc123` (for swarm-mail package)\n- `opencode-swarm-plugin-lf2p4u-xyz789` (for the plugin)\n- `my-app-lf2p4u-def456` (for user projects)\n\n**Fallback:** If no package.json or name field, use `cell-` prefix (not `bd-`)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Cells are identifiable by project at a glance\n- Easier to filter/search across multi-project workspaces\n- Removes legacy \"bead\" terminology from user-facing IDs\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. `generateBeadId()` in swarm-mail should read package.json name\n2. Slugify the name (lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with dashes)\n3. Fallback to `cell` if no package.json found\n4. Keep the random suffix for uniqueness\n\n**Files:**\n- packages/swarm-mail/src/hive/adapter.ts (generateBeadId function)\n- Possibly packages/swarm-mail/src/hive/index.ts","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-18T16:00:54.029Z","updated_at":"2025-12-18T16:32:50.234Z","closed_at":"2025-12-18T16:32:50.234Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
