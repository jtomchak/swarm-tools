## Database Analysis

### File Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Size | 1.4 GB | Unexpectedly large |
| Page Count | 367,414 pages | 4KB pages = 1.47GB theoretical max |
| Page Size | 4096 bytes | Standard SQLite config |
| Free Pages | 0 | No fragmentation |
| Journal Mode | DELETE | Consider WAL for better concurrency |
| Auto Vacuum | OFF | Manual VACUUM required to reclaim space |

### Storage Distribution

```
TOP 5 STORAGE CONSUMERS (by bytes):

1. idx_memories_embedding_shadow    1,453,166,592 bytes (1.35 GB) - 98.2% ⚠️
2. memories                            43,429,888 bytes (41.4 MB) -  2.9%
3. memories_fts_data                    3,137,536 bytes (3.0 MB)  -  0.2%
4. events                               1,638,400 bytes (1.6 MB)  -  0.1%
5. beads                                  856,064 bytes (836 KB)  -  0.06%
```

**CRITICAL:** The vector index consumes 98.2% of database storage. This is a shadow table for libsql vector embeddings - likely for semantic memory search.

### Table Row Counts

| Table | Rows | Avg Row Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|
| `beads` | 1,699 | ~504 bytes | Work item tracking |
| `events` | 2,337 | ~701 bytes | Event sourcing log |
| `messages` | 187 | ~788 bytes | Agent mail |
| `decision_traces` | 182 | ~810 bytes | Coordinator decisions |
| `memories` | 9,021 | ~4.6 KB | Semantic memory storage ✅ |
| `eval_records` | 30 | Variable | Evalite scores |

**NOTE:** The `memories` table initially appeared empty due to a **known libSQL vector extension quirk**: `COUNT(*)` returns 0 on tables with `F32_BLOB` vector columns. Using `COUNT(id)` correctly returns 9,021 rows. The 1.35GB vector index is **actively used** for semantic search with 6,783 embeddings (75% coverage).

## Sessions Analysis

### File Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Size | 8.8 MB |
| File Count | 821 files |
| Total Lines | 7,114 lines |
| Avg Lines/File | 8.67 lines |
| Min Lines | 1 line |
| Max Lines | 710 lines |

### Large Session Files

Top outliers (>100KB):

```
2.4 MB - test-session.jsonl            (33.7% of sessions storage)
719 KB - test.jsonl                    (10.1%)
286 KB - ses_4991aaae4ffehDeJb4nBVLzLBd.jsonl
190 KB - test-session-123.jsonl
158 KB - ses_492a77715ffeyQeioM42wzsF4e.jsonl
126 KB - ses_498fb7388ffe4TFcZ3tLS3N2oN.jsonl
```

**Observation:** 6 files (0.7% of total) account for 43.8% of sessions storage. Test sessions are not being cleaned up.

---

## Event Analysis

### Time Range

- **First Event:** Jan 1, 1970 00:00:01 (invalid timestamp - likely test data)
- **Last Event:** Jan 7, 2026 17:21:51
- **Valid Range:** Dec 20, 2025 - Jan 7, 2026 (18 calendar days, 4 active days)
- **Total Events:** 2,344 events

### Event Type Distribution

Top 10 event types by count:

| Event Type | Count | Avg Size | Total Storage | % of Events |
|------------|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `cell_closed` | 385 | 201 bytes | 75.9 KB | 16.4% |
| `cell_created` | 327 | 227 bytes | 72.5 KB | 14.0% |
| `coordinator_compaction` | 205 | 3,331 bytes | 667 KB | 8.8% |
| `message_sent` | 191 | 843 bytes | 157 KB | 8.2% |
| `coordinator_decision` | 177 | 314 bytes | 54.2 KB | 7.6% |
| `agent_registered` | 144 | 136 bytes | 19.1 KB | 6.2% |
| `memory_found` | 125 | 136 bytes | 16.6 KB | 5.3% |
| `file_reserved` | 81 | 266 bytes | 21.1 KB | 3.5% |
| `thread_created` | 77 | Variable | - | 3.3% |
| `memory_stored` | 72 | 237 bytes | 16.7 KB | 3.1% |

**Insight:** `coordinator_compaction` events are HUGE (3.3KB avg) - 40% larger than any other type. These are context compression summaries.

### Storage by Event Type

```
TOP 5 STORAGE HOGS (by total bytes):

1. coordinator_compaction    682,849 bytes (667 KB)  - 40.2%  📦
2. message_sent              161,007 bytes (157 KB)  - 9.5%
3. cell_closed                77,758 bytes (75.9 KB) - 4.6%
4. cell_created               74,272 bytes (72.5 KB) - 4.4%
5. coordinator_decision       55,541 bytes (54.2 KB) - 3.3%
```

**CRITICAL:** Compaction events (8.8% of events) consume 40.2% of event storage. This is expected - they store compressed session context for resumption.

---

## Operational Metrics

### Bead (Work Item) Distribution

| Status | Count | % of Total |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Closed | 1,401 | 82.5% |
| Open | 285 | 16.8% |
| Blocked | 10 | 0.6% |
| In Progress | 3 | 0.2% |

**Healthy:** 82.5% completion rate. 285 open items may need triage.

### Project Tracking

- **Projects Tracked:** 92 distinct `project_key` values
- **Event Timestamp Issues:** 1,642 events (70%) use `datetime('now')` string literal instead of numeric timestamp - this breaks time-based queries

---

## Growth Projections

### Database Growth Rate

**Calculation:**
- Database size: 1.4 GB
- Active period: 18 days (Dec 20 - Jan 7)
- Growth rate: 1.4 GB / 18 days = **~77 MB/day**

**NOTE:** The 98% vector index is NOT bloat - it's actively used for semantic search with 9,021 memories and 6,783 embeddings. The growth rate is expected for a working vector search system.

### 90-Day Projections

| Scenario | Current | 30 Days | 90 Days | 1 Year |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **With Vector Bloat** | 1.4 GB | 3.6 GB | 8.3 GB | 29.5 GB ⚠️ |
| **After Index Fix** | 30 MB | 81 MB | 183 MB | 651 MB ✅ |

### Sessions Growth

- Current: 8.8 MB (821 files)
- Avg file size: 10.7 KB
- Daily new sessions: ~45 files/day (estimated from 821 / 18 days)
- 90-day projection: **~125 MB** (reasonable)

---

## Performance Issues

### Index Coverage

**Good:** 30+ indexes on key columns (beads.status, events.type, agents.project, etc.)

**Missing:** No composite index on `events(project_key, timestamp)` - common query pattern for project-scoped time series.

### Query Performance Concerns

1. ~~**Vector Index Bloat:**~~ **RESOLVED** - The 1.35GB index is actively used. `COUNT(*)` returns 0 due to libSQL vector extension quirk; `COUNT(id)` correctly shows 9,021 memories with 6,783 embeddings.
2. **Timestamp Format Inconsistency:** 70% of events use `datetime('now')` string - breaks time-based queries and indexes
3. **No Auto Vacuum:** Deleted data doesn't reclaim space - requires manual `VACUUM`
4. **Journal Mode: DELETE:** WAL mode would improve write concurrency

### Slow Query Candidates

Based on event counts and missing indexes:

```sql
-- Likely slow: No index on (project_key, timestamp)
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE project_key = ? 
  AND timestamp > ? 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Vector search is optimized via libsql_vector_idx
-- Use vector_distance_cos() for semantic similarity queries
```

---

## Recommendations

### 🔥 CRITICAL (Do Immediately)

1. ~~**Investigate Vector Index Bloat**~~ **RESOLVED**
   
   **Update (2026-01-07):** Investigation complete. The vector index is NOT bloat - it's actively used:
   - `memories` table: 9,021 rows (use `COUNT(id)` not `COUNT(*)` due to libSQL vector quirk)
   - Embeddings: 6,783 (75% coverage)
   - Semantic search: Working via `hivemind_find()`
   
   **Known libSQL Quirk:** `COUNT(*)` returns 0 on tables with `F32_BLOB` vector columns. Always use `COUNT(column_name)` instead.
   
   **No action needed** - keep the vector index.

2. **Fix Timestamp Format**
   ```sql
   -- Stop using datetime('now') string literal
   -- Use numeric millisecond timestamps: Date.now()
   
   UPDATE events 
   SET created_at = strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000 
   WHERE created_at = 'datetime(''now'')';
   ```
   **Expected Impact:** Fixes 1,642 events, enables time-based queries

3. **Clean Up Test Sessions**
   ```bash
   # Remove test sessions bloating storage
   rm ~/.config/swarm-tools/sessions/test*.jsonl
   ```
   **Expected Impact:** Reclaim 3.3MB (37% of sessions storage)

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (This Week)

4. **Enable Auto Vacuum**
   ```sql
   PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL;
   VACUUM;  -- One-time rebuild
   ```
   **Impact:** Automatic space reclamation on DELETE operations

5. **Switch to WAL Mode**
   ```sql
   PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
   ```
   **Impact:** Better write concurrency, faster commits

6. **Add Missing Index**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_events_project_timestamp 
   ON events(project_key, timestamp);
   ```
   **Impact:** 10-100x faster project-scoped time queries

7. **Implement Session Retention Policy**
   - Archive sessions older than 90 days
   - Compress archived sessions (gzip can achieve 80-90% compression on JSONL)
   - Suggested threshold: Keep latest 1000 sessions, archive rest

### 📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Month)

8. ~~**Monitor Memory Table Usage**~~ **RESOLVED**
   - ✅ Memory table has 9,021 rows (use `COUNT(id)` not `COUNT(*)`)
   - ✅ Vector index is actively used with 6,783 embeddings
   - ✅ Semantic search working via `hivemind_find()`

9. **Event Data Normalization**
   - `coordinator_compaction` events average 3.3KB
   - Consider storing large compaction data in separate table with foreign key
   - Would reduce event table scan overhead

10. **Implement Metrics Dashboard**
    - Track daily event count, database size, table row counts
    - Alert on anomalies (e.g., vector index growth without memory records)

### 💡 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

11. **Partition Event Table**
    - If event count grows >100K, consider partitioning by project or month
    - Archive old events to separate read-only database

12. **Compression**
    - SQLite doesn't compress by default
    - Large text fields (compaction summaries, message bodies) could be gzipped
    - Trade CPU for storage if disk becomes bottleneck

| Storage Efficiency | 8/10 | Vector index is actively used (9,021 memories, 6,783 embeddings) |
| Query Performance | 7/10 | Good index coverage, semantic search working |
| Operational Health | 8/10 | 82% completion rate, reasonable event counts |
| Growth Trajectory | 7/10 | Growth expected for working semantic search |

**Status:** System is healthy. Vector index investigation resolved - it's actively used, not bloat. Remaining issue: timestamp format inconsistency (70% use string format).

---

## Monitoring Checklist

Add these to weekly health checks:

```bash
# Database size
ls -lh ~/.config/swarm-tools/swarm.db

# Table sizes (watch for vector index growth)
sqlite3 swarm.db "SELECT name, SUM(pgsize) FROM dbstat 
  WHERE aggregate=TRUE GROUP BY name ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Row counts (use COUNT(id) for memories due to vector quirk)
sqlite3 swarm.db "SELECT 'memories', COUNT(id) FROM memories;"

# Session storage
du -sh ~/.config/swarm-tools/sessions/

# Event counts by week
sqlite3 swarm.db "SELECT strftime('%Y-W%W', timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') as week,
  COUNT(*) FROM events GROUP BY week ORDER BY week DESC LIMIT 8;"
```

---

## Appendix: Database Schema Health

### Integrity Check Result

❌ **FAILED** - `libsql_vector_idx()` function missing - vector extension not loaded properly

This explains the vector index anomaly - the extension isn't available but the shadow table persists.

### Schema Version

No `schema_version` value found - migration tracking may not be implemented.

### Foreign Key Constraints

**Disabled** (`enable_fkey = off`) - referential integrity not enforced. Consider enabling for data consistency.

---

## Conclusion

**Update (2026-01-07):** The 1.4GB database size is **expected** for a working semantic memory system.

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ Vector index is actively used (9,021 memories, 6,783 embeddings)
- ✅ Semantic search working via `hivemind_find()`
- ✅ `COUNT(*)` returning 0 was a libSQL vector extension quirk, not missing data

**Remaining Action Items:**
1. ~~Drop unused vector index~~ **RESOLVED** - keep it, it's used
2. Fix timestamp format → enable time-based queries  
3. Clean test sessions → reclaim 3.3MB

**Known libSQL Quirk:** Always use `COUNT(id)` instead of `COUNT(*)` on tables with `F32_BLOB` vector columns.
